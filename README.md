# Pokedex

This is a [guided project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli-typescript) I completed as a part of the Boot.dev back-end developer curriculum. The project is a Pokedex CLI application that plays a text-based version of Pokemon. This project focuses on using JSON, making network requests via the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and implementing caching functionality.
